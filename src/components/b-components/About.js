            The project was executed by the developer company SEBRE who bought a
            plot of land previously used as a parking. This development project
            was originally planned as a hotel complex, however, during the
            construction works and archaeological investigation, the developers
            reconsidered the functionality of the building and began the
            cooperation with an architect Stanislav Fiala.
